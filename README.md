# Smart City Waste Management - CI/CD Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project implements a **CI/CD pipeline** for a **TypeScript application** related to the Smart City Waste Management System. The pipeline is designed to automate the processes of building, testing, linting, and deploying the application using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and **Jest**.

The main goal of the project is to automate the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure continuous integration and delivery, maintain high code quality, and streamline deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Git**: For version control.
- **Node.js**: For running the application and testing.
- **npm**: Node package manager (comes with Node.js).
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework used for unit testing.
- **GitHub Account**: For accessing the repository and managing CI/CD workflows.
- **Docker Hub Account** (Optional): For publishing Docker images if needed.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name

Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

bash
npm install

Set up environment variables (if necessary): If your application requires specific environment variables, create a .env file in the root directory and add the necessary variables. For example:

env
bash

NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
The CI/CD pipeline is managed through GitHub Actions. The main workflow file is located at .github/workflows/ci.yml. It automates the following tasks:

Linting: Checks for code style issues using ESLint.
TypeScript Compilation: Ensures that the TypeScript code is correctly compiled.
Jest Testing: Runs unit tests to validate the functionality of the code.
Docker Image Creation: Builds a Docker image for the application.
Deployment (Optional): Configured to deploy the containerized application.
Pipeline Trigger
The pipeline is triggered automatically under the following conditions:

On push to the main branch.
On pull request to the main branch.
Pipeline Steps
The pipeline file (ci.yml) contains the following steps:

Checkout code from the GitHub repository.
Install dependencies: Runs npm install to install project dependencies.
Linting: Executes eslint to ensure the code follows the defined style guide.
TypeScript Compilation: Executes tsc to compile the TypeScript code.
Jest Testing: Runs the Jest test suite to ensure the correctness of the application.
Docker Image Creation: Builds a Docker image for the application.
Docker Integration
This project is containerized using Docker. The Docker setup ensures that the application can run in any environment with consistent results.

Dockerfile
The Dockerfile in the root of the project contains the instructions to build a Docker image for the application. The steps include:

Using an official Node.js image as the base.
Installing dependencies.
Copying the source code into the container.
Running the application on port 3000.
Running the Application with Docker
Build the Docker image: To build the Docker image, run the following command:

bash

docker build -t smart-city-waste-management .
Run the Docker container: Once the image is built, run the application in a container with:

bash

docker run -p 3000:3000 smart-city-waste-management
Access the application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

Jest Testing
Jest is used for unit testing the application to ensure that it functions as expected.

Writing Tests
Tests are located in the tests/ folder. Each file contains unit tests for specific parts of the application.

Running Tests Locally
To run the tests locally, use the following command:

bash

npm test
This will execute the Jest test suite and display the results in the terminal.

Git Issues and Code Reviews
Git Issues Management
Issues are tracked using GitHub Issues. Each issue is linked to a specific commit to ensure traceability. The following steps are followed to manage issues:

Creating Issues: Git Issues are created for bugs, enhancements, or feature requests.
Assigning Issues: Issues are assigned to team members for resolution.
Linking Commits: Commits related to resolving an issue are linked back to the respective issue using keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123").
Code Reviews
Code reviews are performed regularly, and feedback is incorporated into the project. The following process is followed:

Pull Requests (PR): Developers submit pull requests for code review.
Review Process: The reviewer checks for code quality, adherence to standards, and test coverage.
Feedback Implementation: The developer addresses the feedback, and the code is merged once approved.
Troubleshooting
Issue: Docker build fails
Solution: Ensure that Docker is installed and running. Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors, and ensure that the required dependencies are included in the package.json file.

Issue: Jest tests are failing
Solution: Review the test logs for the specific test failures. Make sure all necessary dependencies are installed and up to date. Check for any syntax errors or issues in the code being tested.

Final Report and Analytics
The project includes a final report documenting the pipeline setup, issue management, and lessons learned. Additionally, Power BI dashboard analytics are provided to visualize key metrics such as build success rates, test coverage, and deployment frequency.
